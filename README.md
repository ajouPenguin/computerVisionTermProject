# computerVisionTermProject

This project is computer vision term project.

We use YOLO server and android client.

We fork darknet(https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet) to use YOLO.

and use pre-trained YOLO.weight feature.

Run /YOLO/run.bat -> Server will start.

1. Android client takes picture and send to server.
2. Server extracts feature and send feature to client.
3. Client shows the image with red boxed and labels.
